A more complex project than the previus web page, this one is a pong game with many features included.
The way I run this code is by opening the folder via VS Code and hit the "Go live" button or type "live-server" in the terminal, and for that you will need the live-server extension found in the VS Code by pressing "Ctrl + Shift + X" and searching for it by name.
